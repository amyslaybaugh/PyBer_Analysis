# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the difference in fares between urban, suburban and rural ride-share drivers.


## Results
* Urban drivers earned the most in fares but had the lowest fare per ride.  What they lacked in fare per ride they more than made up for in volume.
* Suburban drivers fell in the middle in both fares per ride and number of rides.
* Rural drivers had the highest fare per ride but the lowest number of fares.


## Summary
Several recommendations for addressing disparities among the city types:
* Rural drivers could command a higher fare per ride to make up for the low volume.  This increase could be justified by the lack of public transit and the limited         number of drivers.
*
